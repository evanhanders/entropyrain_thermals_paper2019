Description of contents:
This tarball contains all of the code used in the production of simulations in the paper, "Entropy Rain: Dilution and Compression of Thermals in Stratified Domains."

In the top-level directory, we have included the main driving scripts:
AN_2D_thermal.py (for running 2D, anelastic, azimuthally symmetric thermal sims)
FC_3D_thermal.py (for running 3D, fully compressible thermal sims)
thermal_analysis.py (for post-processing thermal simulations)
join_data.py (for joining output data from 3D FC runs)
dedalus.cfg (dedalus configuration options)

Inside of the logic/ directory, the driving logic for 3D sims and post-processing can be found:

logic/atmospheres.py (Polytropic atmosphere information)
logic/checkpointing.py (Simulation checkpointing information)
logic/domain.py (Dedalus domain information)
logic/equations.py (Fully compressible equations implementation)
logic/output.py (Specifies output tasks of 3D simulations)
logic/post_processing.py (Function definitions for post-processing)
logic/thermal.py (Specifies thermal initial conditions)

In our code and the simulations presented in the paper, we solved the FC equations using the same nondimensionalization used in Anders & Brown 2017.
This code implementation is nondimensionalized on the temperature gradient length scale at the top of the atmosphere and the isothermal sound crossing timescale of that unit length.
The script logic/post_processing.py appropriately scales all outputs from the 3D simulations into the form presented in our paper and into a form that is directly comparable to the 2D sims.

An implementation of the 3D FC equations in Dedalus code which uses the nondimensionalization that appears in Anders, Lecoanet, & Brown 2019 can be found in the nondim_FC_stratified_thermals/ directory.
The 'nondim_FC_3D_thermal.py' drives the code there in the same manner as FC_3D_thermal.py.

For details on how to run simulations, we have included sample simulation job scripts in the run_scripts/ folder for the NASA Pleiades supercomputer.

We further include the driving scripts used to make the figures in our paper in the paper_plots directory.

System requirements:
This code must be run using python3 on a computer with the open-source Dedalus pseudospectral framework installed. 
See http://dedalus-project.org/ for more information.
All code in this directory should run on commit 1b36cc8 of Dedalus, committed by Keaton Burns on July 25, 2019.
Some prior versions of Dedalus may crash when attempting to run the 3D simulations due to a bug in caching nonconstant coefficients: https://bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus/issues/64/nccs-cause-strange-mpi-crashes-after
